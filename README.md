## Deployment

Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system available for use. The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer side or at the consumer side or both.

In my project we have the vestion of 1.0 initial. after using the softwer the customer will give a feedback. After Taken all requirment we will try to deployed the software for the next version. but now we are through the version 1.0 for the customer.But nest time we will do the work for the Deployment.

## Build With
Java JFrame
Swing
Used to generate RSS Feeds +JavaFX Libray
Versioning
We have only one Version Yet. that is Version 1.0.0 . After 3 month we will release Version 2.0.1
